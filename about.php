		<p class="col-sm-6 col-xs-12">Code Club was founded by Sam Bowers and Charlie Thomas in 2012. 
		We founded this club because we feel that coding is a great skill to know for life regardless 
		of whether you go into computing or not.
		<br>
		Coding is very important in this day and age becuase computers are everywhere and impact us in many ways.
		No matter where you are their is probabley a computer with in a couple of hundread metres of you. Now if computers
		are everywhere and if they are everywhere but we can't control them what is actually the point in having them if all
		we can do is do something someone else has told it to do.
		<br>
		However you may be sitting here thinking but cars are everywhere but we don't learn about them. Well, there is one more argument that 
		I think sells coding for all. Coding is bascially if this do that and that is all life is aswell. Life is all about descions: if cold then wear jumper
		and all coding is writing that in a way a computer can understand.
