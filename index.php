          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>Shipston High's Code Club is a group of people with the desire to learn to control computers. All of us at the Code Club are very proud of the way that we conduct ourselves without the neccessity to learn, which is mainly surprising because of the lack of teacher running the club.</p>

          <h2>Why Learn?</h2>
          <p>The ability to code, in this day and age, is, in our opinion, one of the greatest skills to learn. Coding opens up a whole new world of possibilities and really helps build creativity in people of all ages. Coding in the 21st century is basically the ability to be able to control everything around you to suit your needs. There is jo end o what can be achieved with just a computer and the knowledge of a computer language.</p>
